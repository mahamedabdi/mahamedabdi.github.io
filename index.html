	<h1 id="About"> About Me</h1>

	<p> I remember it like it was yesterday, at the age of 10 getting my first laptop for my birthday. 
	Looking back at it now it was a brick and really slow but that’s when my love of all things technology related grew. 
	Since I can remember I was always into the newest gadgets and innovations. They’ve always intrigued me, the making of them and how they have improved throughout the years.
	Now being 24 years old to see how technology has evolved over the years is mind-blowing. 
	To phones, computers and even internet being available daily it is truly remarkable. I’m currently in a Technology driven program that will give me the chance to further enhance my skills in the field and let me work in sector which I’ve always been passionate about. 
<!--Made a subsection called hobbies so I could add more to the first header, added a
bullleted list to make it look better-->	
	<h2> Hobbies
	<ul>
	<li>Sports</li>
	<li>TV Show Junkie</li>
	<li>Working with youth</li>
	<li>Travelling</li>
	</ul>
	</h2>
<!--Used h2 again since I did another subsection so I could add more detail-->	
	<h2> Fun fact about me:
	</h2>
	<p> Every Sunday morning for the month of April to September I coach a youth basketball league. 
	I’ve been doing this for the past 5 years and it’s helped me in ways I couldn’t even imagine. 
	It’s helped me first and foremost work on my patience with others, I learned that people pick things up at different speeds and not everyone is the same.
	In addition to that I learned how to become a better communicator, some of the kids don’t speak English well as English isn’t their first language so I had to adapt and learn how to communicate them in an efficient and concise way so they do not feel left out.
	Lastly I learned how to be a leader, me being the coach I was the one they looked up to.
	If I wasn’t on time they wouldn’t be in time so I had to lead by example so I could show them the way to act on and off the court.
	Coaching has honestly made me a better person and il continue to do it as long as I can.
